It's awesome to have our own platform to be ourselves and support others' rights. Our group, 'Connected LGBTQ Activists', is made of all kinds of people investing in positive changes. We have regular meetings, plan events and campaigns, to get together and support each other.\n[MEL\n\n[Memory 2]: [Conversation on August 28, 2023 at 03:19 PM] Session 15:\n[CAROLINE]: Hey Melanie, great to hear from you.

It was nice seeing them have a good time outdoors. Time flies, huh? What's new with you?\n[CAROLINE]: Wow, your kids had so much fun at the park! Being outdoors can be really enjoyable. A lot happened since our last chat. I've been chasing my ambitions and had the chance to volunteer at an LGBTQ+ youth center. It was so gratifying to talk to similar young people.

What was it about? What made it so special?\n[CAROLINE]: It was a transgender poetry reading where transgender people shared their stories through poetry. It was extra special 'cause it was a safe place for self-expression and it was really empowering to hear others share and celebrate their identities.\n[MELANIE]: Wow, sounds amazing! What was the event like? Those posters are great!\n[CAROLINE]: The room was electric with energy and support! The posters were amazing, so much pride and strength!

It was wonderful to see how the audience related to what I said and how it inspired them to be better allies. Conversations about gender identity and inclusion are so necessary and I'm thankful for being able to give a voice to the trans community.\n[MELANIE]: Wow, Caroline, you're doing an awesome job of inspiring others with your journey. It's great to be part of it and see how you're positively affecting so many. Talking about inclusivity and acceptance is crucial, and you're so brave to speak up for the trans community.

I'm passionate about helping people and making a positive impact. It's tough, but really rewarding too. Anything new happening with you?\n[MELANIE]: That's awesome, Caroline!

Last Friday, I went to an LGBTQ+ counseling workshop and it was really enlightening. They talked about different therapeutic methods and how to best work with trans people. Seeing how passionate these pros were about making a safe space for people like me was amazing.\n[MELANIE]: Woah, Caroline, it sounds like you're doing some impressive work. It's inspiring to see your dedication to helping others. What motivated you to pursue counseling?\n\n[Memory 3]: Session 12: [CAROLINE]: Hey Mel! How're ya doin'? Recently, I had a not-so-great experience on a hike. I ran into a group of religious conservatives who said something that really upset me. It made me think how much work we still have to do for LGBTQ rights. It's been so helpful to have people around me who accept and support me, so I know I'll be ok!\n[MELANIE]: Hey Caroline, sorry about the hike. It sucks when people are so closed-minded. Strong support really helps. FYI, I finished another pottery project\n\n[Memory 4]: Session 18: 's a chance to be present and together. We bond over stories, campfires and nature. It's so peaceful waking up to the sound of birds and the smell of fresh air - it always refreshes my soul.\n[CAROLINE]: That's so peaceful and calming, Melanie! I can picture waking up to nature. It's great that you get to spend quality, tranquil time with your family.\n[MELANIE]: Thanks, Caroline! This is a great time. Nature and quality time, can't beat it!\n[CAROLINE]: Yeah totally!

My dream is to create a safe and loving home for these kids. Love and acceptance should be everyone's right, and I want them to experience it.\n[MELANIE]: I totally agree, Caroline. Everyone deserves that. It's awesome to see how passionate you are about helping these kids.\n[CAROLINE]: Thanks, Mel.
