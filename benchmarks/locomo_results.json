I used to go horseback riding with my dad when I was a kid, we'd go through the fields, feeling the wind. It was so special. I've always had a love for horses!\n[MELANIE]: Wow, that sounds great - I agree, they're awesome. Here's a photo of my horse painting I did recently.\n\n[Memory 4]: [Conversation on May 25, 2023 at 01:14 PM] Session 2:\n[CAROLINE]: Thanks, Mel! My goal is to give kids a loving home.
